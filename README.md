# ATC MI Interface MQTT Bridge

This is a Python-based project that scans ATC Mi devices and publishes the data to an MQTT server.

## Installation

First, you need to install Python and pip. Then, you can install the dependencies of the project with the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

You can run the project with the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Configuration

You can configure your devices and MQTT server in the `config.yaml` file. An example configuration can be found in the `config.example.yaml` file.

```yaml
